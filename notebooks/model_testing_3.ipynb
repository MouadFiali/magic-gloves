By limiting the data to a specific combination of sensors that remain consistent across movements, we aim to understand how sensor selection influences the model's accuracy and ability to distinguish between similar signs, based on out current dataset.\n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "The results of this experiment underscore the importance of sensor diversity in the precise interpretation of sign language. The model's performance under reduced sensor data underscores the difficulty in distinguishing similar signs and suggests a potential requirement for a comprehensive sensor setup to attain optimal accuracy. Additionally, the model maintained its high performance even when presented with a less detailed sequence of frames, supporting the hypothesis that the model's accuracy is attributable to the distinct nature of the performed signs."
